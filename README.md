# LLM Fine-Tuning, Evaluation & Deployment (IMDB Sentiment Analysis, 50K Reviews)

## üìñ Project Overview
This project demonstrates **end-to-end fine-tuning, evaluation, optimization, and deployment of an LLM** using the **IMDB dataset (50,000 movie reviews)**.  
The goal is to show how to:
- Fine-tune pre-trained models on domain-specific data.
- Evaluate performance with key metrics.
- Apply optimization techniques for memory/latency efficiency.
- Deploy the final model to the cloud for real-world use.

This project is designed as a **portfolio piece** for showcasing practical AI/ML skills in:
- Fine-tuning LLMs
- Evaluation metrics
- Optimization (LoRA, quantization, distillation)
- Testing
- Cloud deployment
